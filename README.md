Installing dependencies
===
you will need node, npm and if you have a fedora/centos flavoured linux you will also want to do this:

su -c 'yum install cairo cairo-devel cairomm-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel pango pango-devel pangomm pangomm-devel'

on a debian box something like this might do the job

sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev build-essential g++

you will want to do one of the above before installing the projects dependencies with npm
